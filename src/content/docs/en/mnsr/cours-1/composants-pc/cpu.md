### üß± **Power-on: the CPU Wakes Up**
    
- The **CPU receives the RESET signal** ‚Üí it enters **real mode** (16 bits, like an 8086).
    
- It automatically starts executing code located at **memory address `0xFFFF0`** (at the top of the 1 MB range).
    

üìç This address is **mapped to the BIOS ROM** (physically connected to the motherboard).

---

‚ö†Ô∏è It's **always the CPU** that executes all code, **instruction by instruction**.

---

### ‚öôÔ∏è  **The CPU Executes the Operating System Kernel**

- The kernel takes complete control.
    
- The CPU switches to **protected mode (32 bits)** then often **long mode (64 bits)**.
    
- The operating system starts up.

## üß† Summary

- **The CPU executes everything**, from power-on.
    
- **Transitions happen via simple assembly instructions** (`JMP`, `CALL`) that redirect execution.
    
- Different chips just "pass control" ‚Üí always executed by **the same CPU**, which simply reads **a new program in memory**.
