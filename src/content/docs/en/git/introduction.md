- **Fast**: Very efficient local operations
- **Integrity**: SHA-1 checksum verification
- **Branches**: Lightweight and efficient branching system

## Key Concepts

- **Repository**: Project storage space
- **Commit**: Snapshot of changes
- **Branch**: Parallel development line
- **Merge**: Combination of branches
